## Frequently asked questions

### What is SD-WAN?

SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) is a technology that simplifies the management and operation of a WAN by separating the networking hardware from its control mechanism.

### How does SD-WAN work?

SD-WAN uses software to intelligently route traffic across the most efficient path, whether that's MPLS, broadband, or LTE, based on real-time network conditions.

### Why choose managed SD-WAN solutions?

Managed SD-WAN provides expert support, reduced complexity, and optimized performance without the need for in-house expertise.

### Why should I consider investing in SD-WAN?

SD-WAN can reduce costs, improve application performance, and provide greater flexibility compared to traditional WAN architectures.

### What's the difference between SD-WAN and SASE?

SD-WAN focuses on network connectivity and optimization, while SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) combines SD-WAN with cloud-native security services.

### What's the difference between managed and standalone SD-WAN?
